 This is the R Markdown Document for Dr. Cannata's Data Visualization class' Project 1.  The first thing I did was create a private Git Repository called DV_RProject1 and clone it into my Data Visualization folder.  I then created an RStudio project and the subfolders '00 Doc', '01 Data', and '02 Visualizations'.  In '00 Doc' I created this Rmd file and started writing about following instructions.  I then copied and pasted the SQL query given to us by Dr. Cannata into my Oracle Database query builder to create the Titanic Data Tables. 



```{r}
load("../01\ Data/DataFrame.RData")
head(df)
summary(df)

```
